# Setup Guide:

- Every Member will pull the master first.
- Then they MUST Create a branch with their name (e.g if your Ali then make a branch named 'Ali').
- You will ALWAYS work in your respective branches.
- Once done create a pull request.
- Pull request will only be merged into master after review.

Cheers.
